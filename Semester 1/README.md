**Assurance of Learning (AOL) Project for Algorithm and Programming (COMP6047001) - First Semester**


As part of the Algorithm and Programming course in the first semester, the Assurance of Learning (AOL) project consisted of two tasks:

1. **Reverse and Inverse String Function**:
   - Objective: Create a function that reverses the order of characters in a given string and inverses the case of alphabetic characters.
     - Example: Inputting "Hello World" should output "DLROw OLLEh".

2. **Property Viewer Application**:
   - Objective: Develop an application capable of:
     - Reading data from a predetermined file, likely containing property information.
     - Displaying properties stored in the file.
     - Sorting properties based on specific criteria such as price or location.
     - Searching for properties based on user input.
     - Creating a new file, possibly for storing modified or filtered property data.

These projects aimed to assess students' understanding of fundamental programming concepts including string manipulation, file handling, sorting algorithms, and search algorithms. They provided an opportunity for students to apply their knowledge in practical programming scenarios, laying the foundation for further learning and development in the field of computer science and software engineering.

- **Project was given the Grade : 100 (A)**
